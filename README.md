<p>If you're a DBA like me you'll probably have a local database instance on your workstation so that you can run a variety of tests quickly on whatever project you're working on. In some cases you might even have a quick backup script so you can save some of your databases safely to your drive.
You'll probably need to run a process that deletes the old database files based on a certain date. Here's some quick SQL Logic which drops the old files from your backup folder based on a retention date. It's based on a Powershell script, and the script will automatically add your backup path and retention date based on the supplied variables.
In this example the backup_path is C:SQLBACKUPS</p>

Here's the quick view before the Powershell script runs from xp_cmdshell, and afterâ€¦

## SQL-Logic
```SQL
use master;
set nocount on
 
declare @backup_path        varchar(255)    = 'C:\SQLBACKUPS\'
declare @retention      varchar(3)  = '0'
declare @config0        int
declare @config1        int
declare @config2        int
declare @removeoldfiles     varchar(555)
set @config0        = (select cast([value_in_use] as int) from sys.configurations where [configuration_id]  = '518')
set @config1        = (select cast([value_in_use] as int) from sys.configurations where [configuration_id]  = '16390')
set @config2        = (select cast([value_in_use] as int) from sys.configurations where [configuration_id]  = '1579')
if  @config0        = 0 begin exec master..sp_configure 'show advanced options', '1'    reconfigure end;
if  @config1        = 0 begin exec master..sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', '1'          reconfigure end;
if  @config2        = 0 begin exec master..sp_configure 'backup compression default', '1'   reconfigure end;
set @removeoldfiles     = 
    'C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -command "&{Get-ChildItem ''' 
    + @backup_path  + ''' -Recurse | Where {$_.creationtime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-' 
    + @retention    + ')} | Remove-Item -Force}"'
 
-- check files before deletion
exec    master..xp_dirtree  @backup_path, 1, 1
 
-- run file deletion with powershell
exec    master..xp_cmdshell @removeoldfiles;
 
-- check files after deletion
exec    master..xp_dirtree  @backup_path, 1, 1
